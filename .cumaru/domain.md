summary: Framework guidance for SDLC Light domain (simplified software-development workflow) and its required workflow.

<!-- cumaru:components -->
| Link | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [host](../src/app.ts) | Deno orchestration for the boot server and main Chat window. |
| [launcher](../run.sh) | Development and packaged launch scripts that attach CEF to a durable browser profile. |
| [bundle](../deno.json) | Desktop package identity, CEF backend, permissions, output path, and macOS application assets. |
<!-- /cumaru:components -->

<!-- cumaru:root -->
**What this is.** A macOS Google Chat desktop wrapper built with experimental `deno desktop` and
the CEF backend. The host opens the remote Chat application and preserves the Google session through
a launcher-managed CEF profile.

**Current architecture.** `src/app.ts` starts the local boot-contract server and creates one Chat
window. Chat owns attachment discovery and loading; the dedicated Laufey build embeds a CEF version
that follows redirected image subresources natively.

**Known platform constraint.** CEF still exposes no navigation interception equivalent to
Electron's window-open policy.

**Stack.** Deno 2.9.6, `deno desktop`, a dedicated Laufey 0.7.0 build, CEF/Chromium 150, and
TypeScript. The currently configured bundle target is macOS.

**Commit messages.** Commits follow the Gitmoji convention. Any emoji available on macOS MAY be
used instead of a catalogued Gitmoji when it meaningfully communicates the commit's intent.

# SDLC Light domain (simplified software-development workflow)

This file declares the SDLC Light domain's specifics — pillars, roles, entry,
and domain context — pulled into context as the root `index.md`'s `depends-on`.
The kernel rules (the node model, the loading rule, conduct, language) live in
`index.md` and are identical across all domains.

## Pillars (root's children)

```
.cumaru/
├── index.md      ← kernel (identical across domains)
├── config.yaml   ← canonical contract
├── domain.md     ← this file (this domain's specifics)
├── plans/        ← everything: tracked items, active plans, completed plans
├── specs/        ← living spec; areas nest subareas
├── exploring/    ← pre-plan ideas in incubation (never loaded by default)
├── roles/        ← agent roles (lead)
└── templates/    ← entity templates
```

- **`plans/` — all work items.** One `plans/<PLAN-ID>/` per item: intake,
  active plan, or completed work. For tracker-backed items the `key:` field
  records the tracker id. Tasks, handoffs, and the delta-draft live inside.
  When a plan closes, its delta is absorbed directly into `specs/` — no
  separate archive pillar.
- **`specs/` — what is true now.** The living spec. Areas nest subareas to
  any depth; `depends-on` is the strongest load signal, `relates` is
  "consider". On plan close the delta is absorbed into the area whose scope
  actually owns it; `git log` is the only cross-reference back to the plan.
- **`exploring/` — pre-plan ideas.** Incubators with no commitment;
  transient. Never loaded by default. Promote to `plans/` when matured.

### Cycle

```
exploring/ ──promote──→ plans/ ──absorb──→ specs/
```

Tracker items (when a tracker is used) feed plans via the `key:` field, but
there is no separate `intake/` pillar — every item lives in `plans/`. Ideas
incubate in `exploring/`. Once committed, they become a plan in `plans/`. On
close, the `cumaru-absorb` skill reads the plan, updates specs, and removes both
the plan dir and the exploring entry that originated it — only `specs/` remains
as durable record.

## Roles

- **Lead** — the sole role. Unrestricted: reads and writes the entire
  `.cumaru/` tree and the repository. Owns planning, spec maintenance,
  exploration, and the absorb flow.

### Shallow indexes per role (entry into the loading rule)

| Role  | Shallow indexes loaded                                       |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lead | `plans/index.md`, `specs/index.md`, `exploring/index.md`     |

### Plan-scoped entry

When a plan is active it declares `scope:` (paths under `specs/`) and
`aux:`; the scoped spec areas are the **declared entry** — the loading-rule
traversal starts from those nodes, nothing else.

## Execution disciplines

Framework-shipped conduct for *how* work is done — distinct from the
pillars, which hold *what* the project is. Every modular file in `disciplines/`
is loaded at context start; `applies-when:` controls when its rules apply,
never whether its body is loaded. `disciplines/index.md` defines how
`strictness:` controls required consideration.

| Discipline | Applies when | File |
|---|---|---|
| cumaru-first | repository work can benefit from a relevant Cumaru surface | `disciplines/cumaru-first.md` |
| code-comments | code or related artifacts are written, edited, reviewed, refactored, or documented where comments may be affected | `disciplines/code-comments.md` |
| engineering | performing software engineering work or reporting technical results | `disciplines/engineering.md` |
| verification | about to claim work complete; before commit / PR / handoff | `disciplines/verification.md` |
| systematic-debugging | a bug / test failure / unexpected behavior — before fixing | `disciplines/systematic-debugging.md` |
| test-driven-development | implementing a feature or bugfix, before writing code | `disciplines/test-driven-development.md` |
| receiving-code-review | acting on code-review feedback | `disciplines/receiving-code-review.md` |
| acceptance-testing | a plan is implemented and about to close — verify acceptance criteria with evidence | `disciplines/acceptance-testing.md` |
| dry | same knowledge / rule risks living in more than one place | `disciplines/dry.md` |
| kiss | choosing how to implement, when a simpler option exists | `disciplines/kiss.md` |
| yagni | tempted to build beyond a present, stated requirement | `disciplines/yagni.md` |
| solid | designing / refactoring structure — responsibilities, extension, coupling | `disciplines/solid.md` |
| blast-radius | fixing scope:/files: for a change whose reach the spec graph doesn't already describe | `disciplines/blast-radius.md` |

## Domain context (web/software)

> The framework was first applied to a web/software workflow. This is
> reference; the kernel itself is not software-specific.

- **vs. OpenSpec** — OpenSpec keeps specs monolithic per capability;
  `.cumaru/` splits by concern, allows per-component divergence and slug-based
  plans, and separates pre-plan ideas in `exploring/`.
- **vs. Kiro / requirements notation** — `.cumaru/` accepts EARS and RFC 2119 as a **warning**, not a
  blocker; narrative sections stay free prose.
- **vs. memory bank (Cline / Roo)** — memory bank focuses on session state;
  `.cumaru/` focuses on durable system state (living spec) + operational plan +
  pre-plan ideation.
