# Don't repeat yourself (DRY)

**Gate:** every piece of knowledge — a rule, a constant, a decision, a contract — has ONE
authoritative home. Before duplicating, ask whether the two sites encode the *same knowledge* or
merely *look alike*. Apply DRY to knowledge, not to characters on screen.

Strictness 8/10: deduplicate by default. The rare, legitimate exception is **coincidental
duplication** — two fragments that resemble each other today but answer to different reasons and
would be wrongly coupled by a shared abstraction. When you keep such duplication, say so
explicitly (a one-line note on why these are not the same knowledge). A forced abstraction that
couples unrelated things is worse than the duplication it removes.

## Red flags

- The same constant, rule, or business decision copy-pasted across files — change one, must change all.
- Two code paths kept in sync by hand, with nothing enforcing it.
- A bug fixed in one place but still alive in its copies.
- The inverse — premature DRY: one abstraction bent with flags and branches to serve callers that
  were never the same knowledge. Prefer the duplication until the shared rule is proven.
