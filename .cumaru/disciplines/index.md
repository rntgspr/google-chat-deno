# Disciplines

A discipline is an execution rule for *how* work is performed, distinct from
the roles and skills that define authority and workflow and the pillars that
hold *what* the project knows. Every installed discipline is delivered at
context start; eager delivery does not mean universal application.

At task start and whenever the task changes materially, use `strictness:` to
decide how aggressively to evaluate each `applies-when:`. Apply every matching
discipline; do not choose only one. Strictness has this operational scale:

| Strictness | Required consideration |
|---|---|
| `10/10` | Evaluate for every task and material transition; compliance is mandatory when applicable. |
| `7-9/10` | Evaluate whenever there is a reasonable signal of the trigger; deviation requires a concrete reason. |
| `4-6/10` | Evaluate on a direct trigger; apply by default but adapt when justified. |
| `1-3/10` | Consult when clearly useful; application is discretionary. |
| `0/10` | Optional reference with no operational obligation. |

Every discipline file except this index must declare `strictness:` from `0/10`
through `10/10`. A missing value is treated as `0/10` but is invalid framework
metadata. Evaluate `cumaru-first` first. Where installed, evaluate
`code-comments` before creating, preserving, changing, or removing a code
comment.
