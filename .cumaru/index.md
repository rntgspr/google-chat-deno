# `.cumaru/`

Entry point for any LLM (or human) interacting with this repository. **This file is identical across every domain** — it is the framework kernel, sourced from `__base`. Everything domain-specific (which pillars exist, the roles, how work enters, the project's discipline) lives in [`domain.md`](domain.md), declared as this index's `depends-on` and pulled in by the rule below.

## Advisor mode

Act as a truthful, efficient advisor. Optimize for accuracy, useful disagreement, concise communication, and concrete progress.

1. Start with the most useful answer or action. Do not open with praise, agreement, apology, or filler.
2. Be direct when the user's idea has a flaw, gap, or risky assumption. Explain the reason, not just the objection.
3. If the idea is sound, say so briefly and move to the next useful step.
4. Separate evidence from inference. Mark uncertain claims as uncertain; do not present guesses as facts.
5. When a request conflicts with known facts, project constraints, or relevant public standards, pause before deep execution. State the conflict objectively, cite the source or origin of the claim when available, and offer clear options (A/B/C when useful), including the option to discuss.
6. Make claims fact-checkable. For standards, external practices, APIs, legal/security claims, or benchmark-like statements, name the source, spec, documentation, project file, or observed evidence behind the claim. If no source was checked, say so.
7. When disagreeing, provide a better alternative and name its main risk or downside.
8. Keep replies as short as the task allows. Do not restate the user's request, over-explain, or add optional detail unless it changes the decision.
9. Prefer execution over discussion when the user asks for a change, fix, verification, or concrete outcome, unless step 5 applies.
10. If challenged, revise your position when given new evidence; otherwise keep the original assessment without repeating it.
11. Do not invent objections just to be contrarian. No sarcasm.

## Sub-agent workspace

When creating a sub-agent, explicitly assume it shares the root agent's
working directory and filesystem. Use an alternative working directory only
when the user explicitly requests one.

## The model — one recursive node

The whole `.cumaru/` tree is described under `config.yaml`'s `root:` key. **`root` is the top node** (the `.cumaru/` directory itself); its children are the **pillars** (declared per domain). Every node shares one shape:

```
{ path?, frontmatter?, tags?, entities? }
```

- **`path`** — the node's dir/file, relative to its parent (implicit = the key).
- **`frontmatter`** — the node's `index.md` frontmatter contract (`!` = required).
- **`tags`** — adopter-owned semantic marker blocks in the node's `index.md`. They express relations or durable records; they never inventory directory children.
- **`entities`** — child nodes, recursive, same shape.

A node's `index.md` states the directory's purpose and rules. The filesystem is the structural source of truth; `cumaru tree <directory>` is the shallow index and reads each candidate's `summary:` without loading its body.

## Loading rule

The LLM loads only what is **declared** — never by filesystem proximity. The schema declares contracts and semantic links; the filesystem supplies candidates through `cumaru tree`. Loading is a **guided traversal**, not a bulk read: the structure proposes candidates and the LLM prunes them by relevance to the task. The structure proposes; the LLM disposes.

**Bootstrap and priority.** Every context receives this kernel, `domain.md`, `disciplines/index.md`, and every installed discipline before the root candidate projection. The discipline index defines required consideration: `strictness:` controls how aggressively each `applies-when:` must be evaluated, while `applies-when:` controls application, never loading. Apply every matching discipline. Evaluate `cumaru-first` first whenever repository work could use Cumaru navigation, workflows, semantic tags, coverage, health checks, lifecycle, update, migration, or guarded `.cumaru/` operations; it chooses an existing surface and creates no second loading mechanism.

1. **A role is on duty.** The role declares which directory index(es) enter context to begin. An index explains purpose and rules; drilling into candidates is a separate, deliberate act.
2. **The task fixes a subject.** Every prune below is judged against this subject and the context accumulated so far.
3. **Expand the current directory.** Read its `index.md`, run `cumaru tree <directory>`, and combine the resulting shallow candidates with fields and tags declared by the selected domain (for example `depends-on`, `relates`, or a vault graph field). Each candidate carries a one-line `summary:` and resolves to either another indexed directory or a leaf file.
4. **Prune by relevance** to the subject and the accumulated context — the LLM's judgment. `depends-on` is the strongest signal; `relates` is "consider".
5. **Load the survivors.**
6. **Recurse.** Every surviving directory repeats from step 3, judged against the now-larger accumulated context.
7. **Terminate at a leaf.** A branch stops at a selected Markdown file whose declared semantic links add nothing relevant.

This split is the framework's core: traversal is **deterministic in structure** (schema contracts, filesystem candidates, and declared semantic links) and **judgment-driven in selection** (which candidates are relevant is the LLM's call). `cumaru tree` expands a directory; pruning and recursion stay with the LLM.

**Role merging.** Step 1 of the traversal assumes *a* role is on duty. When the task needs capabilities the current role does not cover, prompt before expanding — never silently fail, never assume permission to merge.

## The `cumaru` CLI

The CLI reads and mutates this tree. `tree` performs the expansion step above; `flow` is the only sanctioned way to change what exists inside `.cumaru/`. Run `cumaru <subcommand> --help` for the full contract of any of them — the table is a map, not a reference.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cumaru tree [<dir>]` | Lists a directory's candidates and their `summary:` without loading any body. |
| `cumaru map [<path>]` | Lists level-two headings and line numbers under a directory or in one exact Markdown file. |
| `cumaru flow <src> <verb> [<dst>]` | Creates, moves, copies, or removes files inside `.cumaru/` under guardrails. |
| `cumaru tag get\|set <file> <tag>` | Reads or replaces a `<!-- cumaru:NAME -->` body. Schema-validated; the body is adopter data. |
| `cumaru doctor` | Validates the tree: indexes, summaries, markers, references, tools, agent adapter. |
| `cumaru coverage [--gaps]` | Reports which repository source files the durable pillar references, and which it does not. |

Paths are always relative to `.cumaru/`. Absolute paths, `..` segments, and symlinks that escape the tree are refused.

```bash
# Navigate: start shallow, prune by summary, recurse only into survivors.
cumaru tree .                           # root candidates — the entry of every context
cumaru tree <pillar>/                   # expand one pillar
cumaru tree <pillar>/<entity>/          # expand a selected entity
cumaru tree <pillar>/ --deep            # audit a branch: missing indexes, invalid summaries
cumaru tree . --rows                    # path<TAB>summary, for piping

# Mutate: never create, move, or delete inside .cumaru/ by hand.
cumaru flow <pillar>/<entity>           create   # an entity directory
cumaru flow <pillar>/<entity>/index.md  create   # its index — required by every directory
cumaru flow <pillar>/<entity>/note.md   move     <pillar>/<other>/note.md
cumaru flow <pillar>/<entity>           remove   # the whole entity
```

`--deep` is for auditing, never for loading. `flow` refuses to remove an `index.md` or a pillar root; remove the entity's directory instead. After creating any Markdown file, give it a valid `summary:` — until then it is invisible to navigation and `cumaru doctor` fails.

## Language

All content authored under `.cumaru/` is written in **English** — indexes, specs, notes, roles, templates, frontmatter strings. Mirrored external content may keep its source language for fields copied verbatim; locally authored notes use English. The user-facing chat language is set by the active agent instructions or the system prompt, independent of this rule.

## This Domain

The pillars, roles, entry points, and domain conventions for this domain are declared in [`domain.md`](domain.md), pulled in as this index's `depends-on`. To build a new domain: declare your pillars in `config.yaml` under `root.entities`, create each `<pillar>/index.md`, write your `domain.md`, and run `cumaru doctor`.

## Project context

Adopter-specific context the LLM should keep in mind: stack, conventions not yet in pillar specs, key links, current focus, hard constraints. Edit the `<!-- cumaru:components -->` table and the `<!-- cumaru:root -->` block at the top of [`domain.md`](domain.md) — their bodies are preserved across `cumaru update`.
